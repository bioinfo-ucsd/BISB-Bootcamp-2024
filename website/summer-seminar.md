# Summer Flash Talks

This seminar series is intended to be a forum for BISB and BMI faculty to share their research and for incoming students to learn about the research opportunities available.

Each session will host several faculty members, where they will present their research in 12 minutes (+3 minutes of questions). The BISB graduate program coordinator will notify the BISB Program mailing list in the days ahead of each seminar, including information about the presenters and a password-protected link to the Zoom meeting.

If you are unable to attend a seminar or you would like to rewatch a talk, we will post recordings here.

## Schedule

*Seminars will take place 12:00 PM-1:00 PM on Thursday August 15th and and Thursday August 29th.*
